LightroomKeywordHierarchy
=========================

A controlled vocabulary for Lightroom tagging based on IPTC and other sources of keyword hierarchies.

While IPTC is used as a starting point, it's more useful for news stories, so some of the categories don't map well
to photographs.

IPTC subject codes ( http://www.iptc.org/site/NewsCodes/View_NewsCodes/#descrncd ) were used as the basis and the actual IPTC codes are inserted as synonyms.
